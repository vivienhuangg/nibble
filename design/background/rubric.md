| Full implementation           | A (nearly) full set of concepts is implemented, each with a code file and a corresponding and complete specification file.                   | Several concepts are missing; implementations are missing or broken; specifications are missing or out of step with implementations; specifications are incomplete (for example, missing action definitions, or whose state is not fully declared in the standard syntax).                                                                                                                    |
| Modularity                    | Concepts are properly modular, with separation of concerns and no interdependencies.                                                         | Concepts conflate concerns by including state components and actions that belong to a different concern and could easily be separated out; concepts are dependent on one another by making calls or reading (or worse writing) each other’s state; concepts pass composite objects in actions or queries; concept code calls object methods (such as toString) on objects created externally. |
| Principle tests               | For each concept, a successful and legible test execution that corresponds to the operational principle.                                     | No test sequence is present for the operational principle; essential parts of the principle are omitted; the test sequence fails when executed; the execution is not legible because it lacks sufficient output to the console to be understandable.                                                                                                                                          |
| Variant tests                 | For each concept, 3–5 test executions that explore variants, covering all the actions and some interesting cases.                            | Insufficient number of test sequences, or tests are uninteresting; some actions have no successful test executions; executions are not legible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Documented design changes     | The design of the application is updated in a thoughtful and concise way.                                                                    | Design notes are unorganized, needlessly verbose, or focus only on superficial details, omitting more major issues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Recording interesting moments | Design document cites and explains 5–10 interesting moments, with a succinct but compelling explanation of each and links to relevant files. | Moments are not interesting or not explained well; links are missing, or point to mutable files that may have changed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Incremental work              | Context area has not been corrupted or modified and includes snapshots that confirm that you worked in a reflective and incremental way.     | Context has been modified or damaged; too few snapshots suggesting a lack of incremental work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
