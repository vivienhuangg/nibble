| Independence                                | Concepts are fully independent of each other, and can therefore be understood and used independently of one another.                                     | Concept description limits any references to context of use to notes.                                                                    | Concept purpose mentions the way in  which the concept is intended to be used (eg, a payment concept whose purpose says “enables payment for magazine subscription”).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Completeness                                | Each concept provides a complete and coherent unit of functionality that delivers the value described in the purpose without the help of other concepts. | Concept functionality covers entire lifecycle of the purpose.                                                                            | Concept doesn’t include actions for set up (eg, defining available slots for reservations), or for closing down (eg, no deletion for an account).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Separation of concerns                      | Concept does not conflate two concerns that could be broken into separate concepts that could be reused independently of one another.                    | All components of the state work together for a single purpose.                                                                          | The state admits a factoring into two or more independent parts (eg, a user concept mixes preferences and profile fields).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
