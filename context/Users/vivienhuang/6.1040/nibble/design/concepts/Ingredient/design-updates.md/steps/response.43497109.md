# response:

The `Ingredient` concept, as described, does not manage its own state in a dedicated MongoDB collection nor does it have independent actions. Its purpose is to define a reusable *structure* for ingredients that will be embedded within other concepts like `Recipe` and `Version`. Therefore, its "implementation" in TypeScript will be a simple interface definition, rather than a full concept class with `Collection` properties and action methods.

This aligns with the principle of modularity in concept design: `Ingredient` describes *what an ingredient is*, while `Recipe` and `Version` describe *how collections of ingredients are managed* in the context of a recipe.
