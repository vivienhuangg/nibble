# response:

The primary design change for the `Ingredient` concept is a clarification of its architectural role rather than a modification of its internal structure.

* **Concept Spec:** The `Ingredient` was initially presented as a standalone `concept` block, implying it might be implemented as an independent backend service. However, its `actions` section explicitly stated "(Generally managed within Recipe/Version actions)".
* **Implementation & Testing:** In implementation, `Ingredient` is treated as a reusable TypeScript `interface` (data structure) and **not** as a full `Concept` class with its own MongoDB collection or independent API actions. This directly reflects the spec's note that its actions are managed by other concepts, confirming it's an embedded component rather than a top-level entity. Consequently, no dedicated testing for `Ingredient` as a standalone concept is needed.

The defined state properties (`name`, `quantity`, `unit`, `notes`) remain unchanged and are directly mapped to the interface's fields.
