# response:

There are no design changes from the `Ingredient` concept specification to its implementation.

The concept specification for `Ingredient` defines its `state` (name, quantity, unit, notes) and explicitly states that its `actions` are "Generally managed within Recipe/Version actions." This indicates that `Ingredient` is designed as a reusable data structure to be embedded within other concepts rather than being a standalone concept with its own dedicated MongoDB collection and independent actions.

The TypeScript implementation precisely reflects this design by:

1. Defining `Ingredient` as an `export interface`, which is a pure data structure.
2. Including all the specified `state` fields (`name`, `quantity`, `unit?`, `notes?`) with their corresponding types and optionality.
3. Omitting a dedicated `IngredientConcept` class, MongoDB collection properties, or action methods, consistent with the `actions` being managed by other concepts.

The implementation is a direct and faithful translation of the concept spec's intent for `Ingredient` as an embedded component.
