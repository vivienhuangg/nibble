# response:

The major design change for the `Ingredient` concept is:

The `Ingredient` concept, initially described with its own "state" properties, was re-scoped from a full, independently stateful concept that would typically be backed by its own database collection and actions, to a purely **structural data interface (TypeScript `interface`)**. It does not maintain its own MongoDB collection or expose standalone actions; instead, it defines a reusable data structure intended to be embedded within the state of other concepts (like `Recipe` and `Version`).
