# Setup (Prep)

## 0. Fork this repository

First, [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) this repository, and **rename** it to your desired project name, and give a description of your project.

## 1. Install Deno

[Install from Deno's website](https://deno.com)

Deno is a successor to Node.js (by the same creator, Ryan Dahl) that greatly simplifies tooling, is more secure by default, and is backwards-compatible with the larger ecosystem. Check out Deno's [extensive documentation](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/) for various helpful guides on a wide variety of common application needs and [integrations](https://docs.deno.com/examples/).

**Note:** when importing from `npm` packages, prefix with `npm:` as in:

```typescript
import { MongoClient } from "npm:mongo"
```

For VSCode users, consider also installing the Deno [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=denoland.vscode-deno) and referring to the [docs](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/reference/vscode/) if you'd like to configure behavior.

## 2. Compile Context

To create a convenient binary, run the following command from the root of the directory:

```shell
deno compile -A --output ctx .ctx/context.ts
```

## 3. Setup Gemini

Copy or change `.env.template` to the environment file: `.env` and insert your Gemini API key:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash
```

You can choose any [models](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models) using `GEMINI_MODEL`, such as `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` for faster responses, or `gemini-2.5-pro` for higher quality.

You may also edit the `./geminiConfig.json` file to change the parameters according to any of the [GenerationConfig](https://ai.google.dev/api/generate-content#v1beta.GenerationConfig) options, including turning on/off thinking, limiting tokens, etc.

## 4. Setup your MongoDB Atlas Cluster (free)

For this project, we'll be using MongoDB as the database. To get started, use either the slides or the instructions:

### Slides

[MongoDB Setup](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DBOWIQ2AAGQPDRgmnad8wN9S9M955LcHYZQlnbu-QCs/edit?usp=sharing)

### Instructions

1. Create your [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register) account.
2. When selecting a template, choose the **free** option, M0.
3. At the Security Quickstart page, select how you want to authenticate your connection and keep the rest of the defaults. Make sure to allow access to all IPs as shown in [this slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DBOWIQ2AAGQPDRgmnad8wN9S9M955LcHYZQlnbu-QCs/edit?usp=sharing).
4. Once created, click the **CONNECT** button, select **driver**, and copy the srv connection string. If using username and password, the url should look something like this: `mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.p82ijqd.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority`. Make sure to replace username and password with your actual values.
5. Add your connection url (without `<` and `>`) to `MONGODB_URL=<connection url>` to your `.env` file.
6. Give your database a name under `DB_NAME=<your database name>`.

## 5. Install Obsidian

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)

Obsidian is an open-source Markdown editor and personal knowledge management solution. The Context tool **does not** require use of Obsidian, and you may use any preferred editor, but we highly recommend using Obsidian to navigate your assignment and the generated context to write, view, and structure your prompts and design documents.

### Link settings

This should be correctly set already, but under Obsidian -> Settings -> Files and links, make sure that:

1. `New link format` is set to `Relative path to file`
2. `Use [[Wikilinks]]` is disabled
3. `Detect all file extensions` is enabled (so you can easily view code and drop links to code files)
