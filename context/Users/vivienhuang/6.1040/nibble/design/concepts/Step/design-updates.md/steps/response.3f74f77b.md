# response:

* **Persistence Model**:
  * **Concept Spec**: The `Step` concept defines its `state` and notes that its `actions` are "Generally managed within Recipe/Version actions," leaving its data persistence model (i.e., whether it's a top-level entity or embedded) implicit.
  * **Implementation**: The `Step` is explicitly implemented as an **embedded document** (value object) within `Recipe` and `Version` documents in MongoDB, rather than as a standalone collection managed by its own `StepConcept` class. The `StepConcept` class itself is a structural placeholder and does not manage any database collections.
