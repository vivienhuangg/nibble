# response:

There are no explicit, contrasting major design changes from the `Step` concept specification to its implementation. The implementation directly reflects the conceptual design:

* **Actions Management**: The concept spec explicitly states `(Generally managed within Recipe/Version actions)`. The implementation adheres to this by not defining any actions or managing its own MongoDB collections, confirming `Step` is an embedded object rather than a standalone service.
* **State Structure**: The concept spec defines `Step`'s state without a unique `id`. The implementation reflects this by defining `Step` as an interface to be embedded within other documents (like `Recipe` or `Version`), rather than as a top-level entity with its own collection.
