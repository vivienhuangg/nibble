# response:

The major design changes from the `Step` concept specification to its implementation are:

* **Persistence Strategy**:
  * **Concept Spec (Implicitly):** Defined as a `concept`, which typically implies a standalone backend service managing its own persistent state.
  * **Implementation:** Explicitly treated as an **embedded document/value object** within `Recipe` and `Version` concepts, rather than a top-level entity with its own dedicated MongoDB collection or a `StepConcept` class managing direct database operations for `Step` instances. The `StepConcept` class itself serves as a structural placeholder, not an active data manager for `Step` objects.
