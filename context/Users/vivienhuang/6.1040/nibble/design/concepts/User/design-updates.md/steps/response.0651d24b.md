# response:

Here's a summary of the contrasting major design changes from the `User` concept specification to its implementation:

1. **Password Representation:**
   * **Concept Spec:** The `password` field is defined as a `String`, implying its storage as-is.
   * **Implementation:** The implementation introduces `passwordHash: string` for password storage, explicitly acknowledging the security best practice of hashing passwords. While the example implementation stores it in plain text for simplicity of the exercise, the design change highlights the intent for secure handling.

2. **Explicit Error Handling in Actions:**
   * **Concept Spec:** Actions like `registerUser` and `login` are specified with successful return types (`user: ID`) and `updateProfile` with an `Empty` return, without explicitly detailing how errors are communicated.
   * **Implementation:** All actions are designed to return a `Promise` that resolves to either the successful result (`{ user: ID }` or `Empty`) *or* an explicit error object (`{ error: string }`). This introduces a robust and consistent mechanism for reporting failures as part of the action's public API.
