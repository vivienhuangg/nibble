# response:

Here's a summary of major design changes from the `User` concept specification to its implementation:

1. **Password Storage:** The concept specification implies `password` primarily as an argument for `registerUser` and `login` actions. The implementation explicitly introduces `passwordHash` as a persistent field within the `User`'s state (`UserDoc`). This reflects a practical security consideration to store a hashed (though simplified to plain text for this exercise) version of the password rather than the raw password itself.
2. **Explicit Query Methods:** The concept specification did not list any explicit query actions. The implementation adds two query methods (`_getUserDetails` and `_getUserIDByEmail`) to allow fetching user information based on their ID or email, which are essential for practical usage of the concept.
3. **Unified Error Handling:** While the concept allows for overloaded action results (e.g., returning `user` on success or `error` on failure), the implementation adopts a consistent `Promise<{ successResult } | { error: string }>` return signature for all actions, explicitly standardizing how errors are communicated to callers.
4. **ID Type Concretization:** The abstract `UUID` type for `id` in the concept state is concretized to a branded `ID` string type in the implementation, aligning with the project's specific utility for managing identifiers in MongoDB.
