# Exercise 0

Context is a simple Markdown-based framework for building design knowledge and collaborating with an LLM. There is no additional syntax: any text-based repository with code of any language with documentation written as Markdown is compatible.

## 0. Note

**Important:** do not delete or modify anything from the `context` directory. Content is hashed by ID, meaning that corruption can be detected, but not recovered from automatically. This pairs nicely with git in case you mess up, so don't forget to commit once in a while!

## 1. Getting started with Context

Context allows you to treat any Markdown document as a conversation with an LLM: everything in the document is exactly what both you and the LLM sees. Each step is broken up by `# Heading 1` sections, and you should begin every new prompt or chunk of interesting information using a new section 1 heading.

### Task:

In `design/brainstorming/questioning.md`, complete the `# prompt: Why ... ?` with your burning question for the universe. Then, from the root of the repository, run this command in the terminal (if you're using Obsidian, you should be able to copy the command by clicking on `Shell` in the top right):

```shell
./ctx prompt design/brainstorming/questioning.md
```

You should see any thinking appear in the terminal, with the rest of the completion streamed into the file. In general, you can `prompt` a LLM to chime in with

```shell
./ctx prompt <path_to_file>.md
```

where `<path_to_file>` is also a link **relative to the root** of the repository.

## 2. Including context

You can **include** other documents to embed their contents, allowing you to compose exactly the context that you want. In Obsidian's file explorer on the left, expand the `design/background` and `design/learning` folders, then click on `understanding-concepts`. This should open a blank document.

### Task:

Drag and drop `concept-design-overview` into the body of `understanding-concepts`. This should show up as a normal link. Then, to make it a link that Context will include, simply add the `@` sign to the beginning of the link text (the part in the brackets), like so:

![](media/linking.png)

**Important:** includes should be on their own paragraph - make sure that there's an empty line between them and other content.

Next, type `# question: ...` and fill in any question you have about concepts, then prompt through Context.

**Tip:** you can easily get the relative link you need to paste into a terminal after `./ctx prompt` by right/ctrl clicking the file in the explorer directly:

## 3. Viewing context

The `context` directory is an immutable and complete history of every file that the tool interacts with - this means that you shouldn't be afraid of editing or deleting files! This directory is a mirror of the rest of the repository, just nested one layer deeper. In addition, files such as `understanding-concepts.md` become a directory, as in `understanding-concepts.md/` and contain a timestamped version of its entire history.

### Context folders

Each Markdown file within these directories have the format `timestamp.hash_id.md`, where the `hash_id` is a **content-based hash** that helps you identify, across the entire repository, usages of the same document or content.

### Individual steps

Inside the `steps` directory one layer deeper are granular files of the form `step.hash_id.md` that contain all the unique steps (`# heading 1` blocks) ever present in the file. This helps identify at-a-glance what the contents of each document are, such as prompts or responses. By default, the `step` in the file name is a `_` character, unless the heading contains a prefix of the form `# prefix: ...`, which can be a useful way to break up a document (that you can follow yourself, or prompt an LLM to do so).

**Important:** this is the reason for the previous warning about not modifying the `context` directory. The content-based hashes means we can detect such edits/deletes, but the more important point is that you keep a legible history of your design choices and explorations (which can be invaluable for prompting!)

### Task:

1. Consider again `design/brainstorming/questioning`, and **find** the version of the document in `context` containing the LLM's response. Note that `ctx prompt` will save both a before and after version. Drag or insert a link to this in `design/learning/exercise-0`
2. Go back to `questioning`, and **edit** the response to put in your own typed answer. **Tip:** you can collapse the entire response heading (hover to the left of the heading, and click the downwards arrow) and select it quickly to delete the entire block.
3. Use `./ctx save <link_to_questioning.md>` to manually **save** the file to `context`, then find the updated version and link to it in the `exercise-0` document.
4. Use Context to save `exercise-0` as well. (Optional): delete any of these files - if you've properly saved/prompted, we'll be able to find it in the context. We encourage you to continue to prompt/save your brainstorming and learning, and they will help with finding interesting moments for your assignment!

**Note:** `ctx save` is only necessary if you manually edit files, such as your second response to `questioning` or your solutions that you copy paste into `exercise-0`. Any time you `ctx prompt`, both the before and after versions are automatically saved.
