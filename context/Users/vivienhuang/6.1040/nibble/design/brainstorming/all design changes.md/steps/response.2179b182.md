# response:

To implement the `Step` concept, it's crucial to first understand its role within the larger application design. As per the concept design document:

* **`Step`'s Actions**: The specification explicitly states "(Generally managed within Recipe/Version actions)". This means `Step` does not have its own independent set of API endpoints or methods to create, update, or delete steps directly. Its behavior is encapsulated and managed by the `Recipe` and `Version` concepts.
* **`Step`'s State**: The `Recipe` concept's state includes `steps : List[Step]`. This indicates that `Step` instances are intended to be embedded documents or value objects within `Recipe` (and `Version`) documents in MongoDB, rather than existing as separate top-level collections with their own unique identifiers (`_id`).

Given these characteristics, `Step` is not a standalone backend service that requires a full `StepConcept` class managing its own MongoDB collection(s). Instead, its "implementation" primarily involves defining its data structure as a TypeScript interface, which will then be used by `RecipeConcept` and `VersionConcept` to type the `steps` array in their respective document structures.

However, to strictly adhere to the requested output format `# file: src/{name}/{name}Concept.ts`, we will create a `StepConcept.ts` file that exports both an (empty) class and the `Step` interface. The class serves as a placeholder, explicitly stating that it does not manage its own collections or actions, while the interface defines the actual data structure of a `Step`.
