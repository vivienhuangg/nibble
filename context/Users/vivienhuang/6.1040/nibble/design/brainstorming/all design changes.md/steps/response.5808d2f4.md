# response:

Here are the contrasting major design changes from the concept specification to its implementation:

* **Delegation of Cross-Concept Precondition Enforcement:**
  * **Concept Spec:** Actions like `shareRecipe` and `unshareRecipe` specify complex preconditions involving other concepts (e.g., `sharer = recipe.owner`, `requester = recipe.owner`, `member exists`). This implies the `Notebook` concept itself is responsible for validating these external relationships.
  * **Implementation:** The `NotebookConcept` implementation explicitly *defers* these cross-concept checks (e.g., `sharer = recipe.owner` or `member exists`) to external synchronization mechanisms or prior validation, focusing solely on the internal state relevant to the `Notebook` concept itself (e.g., if a recipe is already shared, if a user is already a member). This reinforces the principle of concept independence.
* **Explicit Error Handling as Return Values:**
  * **Concept Spec:** Actions primarily describe successful outcomes and state changes, with error cases often implicit or briefly mentioned in `requires` clauses.
  * **Implementation:** All actions are designed to return a structured response, either the successful outcome or an `{ error: string }` object with specific error messages for failed preconditions. This provides a clear and consistent API contract for both success and failure states.
