Please provide the content of your `app-overview.md`!

I can definitely help you evaluate it once I see it. To give you the best feedback, I'll be looking for:

1. **Clarity and Conciseness:** Is the language easy to understand? Does it get straight to the point without unnecessary jargon or fluff?
2. **Target Audience Appropriateness:** Who is this document for (developers, product managers, stakeholders, end-users)? Does it provide the right level of detail for that audience?
3. **All Concepts Defined:**
   * Are all core entities, data types, and key terminology clearly explained?
   * Is there a glossary or are terms defined inline when first introduced?
   * Are relationships between concepts clear?
4. **All Actions Defined:**
   * Are the main user flows and system operations described?
   * What can users *do* with the app?
   * What are the system's major automated processes?
   * Are the inputs and expected outputs for these actions clear?
5. **All Queries Defined (if applicable):**
   * If the app involves specific ways of retrieving information (e.g., search, filtering, reporting), are these outlined?
   * What kinds of questions can the app answer?
   * What data points are relevant for these queries?
6. **Overall Structure and Flow:** Is the document logically organized? Does it progress naturally from high-level concepts to more specific details?
7. **Completeness:** Does it cover all essential aspects of the app (e.g., purpose, key features, architecture overview, data flow, integrations, future plans)?
8. **Consistency:** Are terms used consistently throughout? Are there any contradictions?
9. **Problem/Solution Alignment:** Does it clearly state the problem the app solves and how it solves it?

**Once you paste your `app-overview.md`, I'll give you specific feedback based on these points.**
